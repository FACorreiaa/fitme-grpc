# fitme-grpc

Rewrite of the FitME rest version to a  gRPC infrastructure with a strong emphasis on middleware, tracing, and logging integration.
The use of a shared proto directory and containerized service architecture gives plenty of flexibility in handling upstream services and dependencies.

The approach to middleware managementâ€”ensuring correct ordering for context propagation, handling panics, and managing logs and metrics, wrapping OpenTelemetry's middleware for future-proofing against breaking changes.

TODO
 - Fix Prometheus
 - Loki
 - Tempo
 - Complete Grafana (In production, configure ingres and point to prometheus-grafana)
 - All above with Kubernetes
 - Finish all services
 - Message system to communicate between PT and its clients (add communications between Institution and PTs?)
 - Kafka (?) message queue system and notifications between users and PTs
 - PDF builder: https://github.com/johnfercher/maroto
 - CSV and Excel builder: check Domonda
- K8s deployment
- Where to deploy ?


## Traces
- Exporters: Stdout, Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog and OpenTelemetry (OTLP) collector
- Importers: OpenTracingShim
## Metrics
- Exporters: Prometheus, Datadog, and OpenTelemetry (OTLP) collector
- Importers: SwiftMetricsShim
## Logs
- Exporters: OpenTelemetry (OTLP) collector

For dev:
Tempo => kubectl port-forward svc/tempo 4317 -n monitoring
Grafana => kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring
Prometheus => kubectl port-forward prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0 9090 -n monitoring
