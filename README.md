# fitme-grpc

Rewrite of the FitME rest version to a  gRPC infrastructure with a strong emphasis on middleware, tracing, and logging integration.
The use of a shared proto directory and containerized service architecture gives plenty of flexibility in handling upstream services and dependencies.

The approach to middleware managementâ€”ensuring correct ordering for context propagation, handling panics, and managing logs and metrics, wrapping OpenTelemetry's middleware for future-proofing against breaking changes.
