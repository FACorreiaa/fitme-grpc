`# FitME-gRPC

Rewrite of the FitME REST version to a gRPC infrastructure with a strong emphasis on middleware, tracing, and logging integration.
By sharing proto definitions and containerizing services, this project achieves flexible inter-service communication while ensuring proper context propagation, error handling, and telemetry across the stack.

## Overview
FitME-gRPC is a rewrite of the original FitME REST API into a gRPC-based service architecture. The project is built with a strong emphasis on robust middleware management, comprehensive tracing and logging, and seamless integration with modern observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo). It aims to improve scalability and maintainability while providing enhanced telemetry and debugging capabilities.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

- Backend:
1. Language: Go (Golang)
2. Communication: gRPC with shared proto definitions
3. Middleware: Custom middleware layers wrapping OpenTelemetry for tracing, logging, and metrics
4. Database: PostgreSQL
5. Caching: Redis

- Telemetry:
1. Tracing: Stdout, Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog, and OTLP collector
2. Metrics: Prometheus, Datadog, and OTLP collector
3. Logs: OTLP collector (integrated with Loki)
4. Containerization: Docker (with Kubernetes deployment for production)

- Other Tools:
1. PDF builder: Maroto
2. CSV/Excel builder: (see Domonda for inspiration)

## Core Features
- gRPC Infrastructure:
Fully containerized and using gRPC for high-performance communication between services.

- Middleware Management:
Ensures proper ordering for context propagation, panic handling, logging, and metrics collection. Uses wrappers around OpenTelemetry middleware to guard against breaking changes.

- Observability:
Integrated with multiple telemetry backends including Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, and Jaeger.

- Data Exporters:
Support for PostgreSQL, Redis exporters, and integration with message systems for notifications (e.g., Kafka).

## Telemetry

2. Use HRV (Heart Rate Variability) analysis (if they wear a smartwatch) to detect stress.
3. Personalized daily mood check-ins → AI suggests stress-relief activities.

- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Tools

1. AI-based journaling assistant (users log thoughts, AI suggests coping strategies).
2. Daily affirmations & gratitude journaling with AI insights.
3. Chatbot for low-level mental health support (before professional intervention).

- Sleep Tracking & Optimization

1. Sync with wearables (Oura, Fitbit, Apple Watch, Whoop) to track sleep cycles.
2. AI suggests optimal sleep schedule & bedtime routines.
3. Integration with blue light blocking & relaxation sounds before sleep.

- AI-powered Stress & Recovery Score

2. Suggests "rest vs. workout" days dynamically based on recovery.
3. Tells trainers if a client is overtraining or needs recovery.

### AI-Powered Healthcare Insights
With our own AI model, each user can have a personal AI health assistant.

- AI predicts injuries & burnout risk from past workout data.
- AI detects signs of depression based on user activity, journaling & HRV.
- AI analyzes blood test results (users upload results, AI explains trends).
- AI suggests supplements based on diet gaps & training intensity.

### Social & Gamification

1. Trainer-led groups for clients (chat, workouts, accountability).
2. Workout buddies & accountability partners matching.
3. Integration with social media for sharing progress (optional).

### Hybrid Web & Mobile Strategy
TODO web platform?
- YES if want to expand into nutritionists, therapists, doctors, and more trainers.
- NO if keep it strictly fitness-focused, since most users will engage via mobile.

## How to split features across platforms?
### Web for Trainers & Healthcare Providers

- Dashboard for tracking client progress.
- Scheduling & video calls.
- Billing & subscription management.

### Web for Advanced Users (if included)
- Meal planning (drag & drop UI).
- Workout plan customization.
- In-depth analytics & reports.

### Mobile for General Users

- Gamification, social feed & challenges.

### Health Data Integrations
Since dealing with fitness + health, deeper biometric tracking would be a killer feature.

- Apple Health, Google Fit, Strava → for workout tracking.
- Oura, Whoop, Fitbit → for HRV & recovery insights.
- Blood test API integration (e.g., InsideTracker) → AI analyzes health markers.

### Advanced Features for Trainers & Gyms
- Auto-Generated Workout Plans & Adjustments
1. AI analyzes user progress, soreness, and energy levels.
2. Auto-adjusts workout intensity based on recovery.
3. "AI spotter" alerts if weight selection seems off.

3. Auto-generates shopping lists based on meal plans.

- Gyms & Trainers Marketplace
1. Trainers can list services & packages.
2. Users can book sessions directly.
3. AI matches trainers to clients based on goals & experience.

### Meal Plan Validation
- Purpose:
Ensure that a meal plan aligns with the user's objective (e.g., maintenance mode should not exceed a specific calorie goal).
- Guidance:
Warn users if their meal plan exceeds their objective's calorie goal, allowing for adjustments or confirmations.
- Flexibility:
Optionally allow overrides while logging such events for further review.

### Access Telemetry UIs:

Grafana: http://localhost:3000
Jaeger: http://localhost:16686
Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
Loki: Use the mapped port (e.g., http://localhost:3100 for API requests)

# High-Level Technical Requirements
## API/Backend Services

Go with gRPC. Organize your services by domain—e.g.:
1. UserService (handles sign‐up, login, user profiles, roles, friend requests, etc.)
2. MessagingService (handles chat, file sharing, or you can split file sharing out)
3. NotificationsService (handles push/email notifications, in‐app notifications)
4. WorkoutService (exercise sessions, workout plans)
5. DietService (meal plans, ingredients, logs)
6. TrainerService / GymService (manages trainer–client relationships, gym data, classes, etc.)
7. Each service exposes gRPC endpoints.
8. Real-Time Communications (Chat & Video Calls)

## Chat:
Implement chat over gRPC streams (bidirectional streaming) or use WebSockets.
Store conversations/messages in PostgreSQL (or a NoSQL store).
## Video Calls:
Typically done with a signaling server that sets up a WebRTC or other real-time protocol.
Do signaling over gRPC streams or a separate WebSocket.
Actual video/voice runs peer-to-peer (or via SFU/MCU if group calls).

## Notifications
You will want an internal mechanism (e.g., a small pub/sub or events) to generate notifications for “new message,” “new plan,” “friend request,” etc.
Store them in a notifications table, with a “read/unread” flag.
Send push/email/SMS via third-party providers (SendGrid, Twilio, etc.).

## File Sharing
Typically store actual files in an object store (S3, GCS, etc.).
In DB, store only references/URLs and metadata (filename, size, content type, etc.).
Integrations for:

## Email invites (SendGrid/Mailgun/SES).
SMS invites (Twilio, etc.).
Social media (Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/TikTok) if you want to share a link to invite.
Live streaming to Instagram/TikTok typically requires those platforms’ official APIs. Usually you’d generate an RTMP URL/stream key from the social platform, then push your video feed to it.
Leaderboards & Achievements

## Keep track of user points in a table (e.g. user_points).
A separate table for achievements (e.g. achievements + user_achievements).
Personal Trainer & Gym Entities
